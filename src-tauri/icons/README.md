# Icons

To generate proper icons for your app:

1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG icon (e.g., `app-icon.png`)
2. Run: `npm run tauri icon app-icon.png`

This will generate all required icon formats automatically.

For now, placeholder icons are included to make the build work.
You should replace them with your actual app icons before releasing.
